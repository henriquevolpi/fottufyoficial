‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do not break or modify any existing feature that is currently working (authentication, dashboard, photo upload, gallery view, project creation, etc).

‚úÖ GOALS:
I want to launch a subscription system with upload limits, plan management, and Stripe checkout integration.

üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Tasks:

1. Fix subscription page
- Make sure the current subscription page loads properly.
- Display the 3 available plans clearly:
  ‚Ä¢ R$15/month ‚Üí 1,500 total uploads
  ‚Ä¢ R$35/month ‚Üí 5,000 total uploads
  ‚Ä¢ R$120/month ‚Üí unlimited uploads
- Each plan must have a "Subscribe" button that:
  ‚Ä¢ Sends the correct plan type and amount to Stripe checkout
  ‚Ä¢ After payment, assigns the upload limit to the user account

2. Create a public pricing page at `/planos` or `/pricing`
- This route should be accessible even for visitors not logged in
- Show the 3 plans with description and price
- Add ‚ÄúSubscribe‚Äù buttons linked to Stripe checkout

3. Setup Stripe with fixed Price IDs (recommended)
- Use hardcoded or pre-configured Stripe Price IDs for each plan:
  ‚Ä¢ price_15BRL_ABC123 ‚Üí 1,500 uploads
  ‚Ä¢ price_35BRL_DEF456 ‚Üí 5,000 uploads
  ‚Ä¢ price_120BRL_GHI789 ‚Üí unlimited
- When a user completes payment, use the webhook to:
  ‚Ä¢ Store the plan type (`basic`, `pro`, or `unlimited`)
  ‚Ä¢ Set the correct `uploadLimit` in their account
  ‚Ä¢ Initialize `usedUploads = 0`

4. Upload Limiting System
- On every photo upload, check if:
  ‚Ä¢ usedUploads < uploadLimit ‚Üí allow upload
  ‚Ä¢ Else ‚Üí block and show a warning: ‚ÄúUpload limit reached. Please upgrade your plan.‚Äù
- When photos are deleted:
  ‚Ä¢ Reduce usedUploads count accordingly
- Show a visual counter on the dashboard:
  ‚Ä¢ Example: ‚Äúüì∑ 327 / 1500 uploads used‚Äù

5. Stripe Webhook Handling
- On successful payment, receive plan and user email
- Update their plan, limits and Stripe info in the database
- If subscription is canceled or payment fails:
  ‚Ä¢ Block dashboard access and show a ‚ÄúRenew Plan‚Äù screen

‚úÖ Summary:
‚Ä¢ Plans: R$15 (1,500 uploads), R$35 (5,000), R$120 (Unlimited)
‚Ä¢ Public pricing page: `/planos`
‚Ä¢ Stripe integration (working checkout + webhooks)
‚Ä¢ Upload count management
‚Ä¢ No disruption to current working features
