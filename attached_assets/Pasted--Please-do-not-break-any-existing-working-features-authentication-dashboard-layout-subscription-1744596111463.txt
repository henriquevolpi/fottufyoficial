‚ö†Ô∏è Please do not break any existing working features (authentication, dashboard layout, subscription system, Stripe, etc). Only fix the main issue described below.

üß© MAIN ISSUE: The client project link is not working correctly because the project and uploaded photos are not being properly saved in the backend.

When I create a gallery and click the ‚ÄúClient Link‚Äù, the URL (e.g. `/project-view/:id`) shows:
> ‚ÄúProject not found ‚Äî The project you're trying to access doesn't exist or was removed.‚Äù

This means the project and photos are either not stored in the backend or not connected properly.

---

‚úÖ What needs to be implemented:

1. **Backend Project Creation:**
   - When a new gallery is created and photos are uploaded:
     - Save the project to the database with:
       - Project ID
       - Project name
       - Client name and email
       - Photographer/owner ID
       - Creation date
     - Save all uploaded photos with:
       - Original file name (‚ö†Ô∏è **do not rename the files**)
       - Photo URL or path
       - Project ID (as foreign key)
       - `selected: false` (default)

2. **Client Gallery Page (`/project-view/:id`):**
   - Use the `:id` to fetch the project from the backend
   - Load all associated photos from the project
   - Display them in a grid for the client
   - Allow the client to:
     - Select and deselect photos (toggle selection)
     - Show visual indicator when a photo is selected
     - Click ‚ÄúFinalize Selection‚Äù button
   - When finalized:
     - Save the selected photo IDs (set `selected: true` in the backend)
     - Keep the data tied to that specific project only

üìé Additional Notes:
- Each project must be uniquely stored and retrievable by its own ID.
- Uploaded photos must be fully connected to their project.
- Do not use mock IDs or temporary frontend-only data.
- Keep the **original file names** of all uploaded images. Do not rename them during upload or save.

Please confirm when this is implemented and fully working.
