‚ö†Ô∏è Please apply the following 3 focused fixes ‚Äî do NOT touch anything else that is currently working.

---

‚úÖ 1. FIX: Projects can't be edited after logout
Problem:
- When I create a project while logged in, I can edit it immediately.
- But if I logout and then log back in, I lose access to edit my own projects.
Cause:
- The backend is not correctly checking that the project belongs to the currently logged-in user (photographerId).
Fix:
- Ensure each project saves the correct photographerId when created.
- When accessing/editing a project in the dashboard, the backend should allow access if project.photographerId === loggedInUser.id.

‚úÖ 2. FIX: Public client link is wrongly blocked
Problem:
- When I open a client gallery link like /project-view/:id, I get a message saying ‚ÄúYou cannot view this project because it belongs to another photographer‚Äù.
- This should never happen.
Clarification:
- Client links (like /project-view/:id) are meant to be 100% public.
Fix:
- The route /project-view/:id should be accessible by anyone, even without login.
- Do NOT apply any photographerId or session validation on this route.
- Just load the project and its photos if the public ID is valid.

‚úÖ 3. FIX: Project links are not unique
Problem:
- The system is using incremental project IDs in URLs like /project-view/1 or /project-view/2.
- These IDs can collide across different user accounts and expose unrelated projects if guessed.
Fix:
- When creating a new project, generate a unique random public ID using something like `nanoid()` and save it as `publicId`.
- URLs should now use: /project-view/:publicId instead of numeric project.id.
- In the backend, fetch the project using this `publicId` (not the internal ID).

üõë VERY IMPORTANT: 
Please do NOT break or modify any of the following that are currently working:
- Upload functionality
- Logout
- Dashboard stats or layout
- LocalStorage or login/session management
- Subscription logic
- Stripe integration

üß† Make only these 3 fixes, test them carefully, and let me know what changed.
