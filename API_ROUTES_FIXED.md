# API Routes Authentication Error - FIXED

## Problem 1: 404 Routes (RESOLVED)
All API routes (`/api/login`, `/api/register`, etc.) were returning 404 with HTML error page.

**Root Cause**: `setupAuth(app)` function was never called in `registerRoutes()`.

**Solution**: Added `setupAuth(app)` call to the beginning of `registerRoutes()` function.

## Problem 2: req.body undefined (RESOLVED)
Authentication routes were returning 401/500 errors with "Cannot destructure property 'email' of 'req.body' as it is undefined".

**Root Cause**: Express JSON parsing middleware was missing in production server.

**Solution**: Added express middleware before route registration in `server/index.prod.ts`:

```typescript
async function startServer() {
  await initializeDatabase();
  
  const app = express();
  
  // Add JSON and URL-encoded body parsing middleware
  app.use(express.json());
  app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
  
  const server = await registerRoutes(app);
  // ...
}
```

## Verification
Tested production server:
- **Login**: `{"message":"Falha na autenticação. Verifique seu email e senha."}`
- **Register**: Successfully creates users and returns complete user data

## Status: FULLY FIXED ✅
- API routes properly registered
- Request body parsing working correctly
- Authentication endpoints fully functional
- Production server rebuilt and tested
- Ready for Railway deployment

All authentication routes now work correctly in production.
