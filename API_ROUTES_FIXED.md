# API Routes 404 Error - FIXED

## Problem
All API routes (`/api/login`, `/api/register`, etc.) were returning 404 with HTML error page:
```
Cannot POST /api/login
```

## Root Cause
The `setupAuth(app)` function was never called in `registerRoutes()`, so authentication routes were not being registered in production.

## Solution Applied
Added `setupAuth(app)` call to the beginning of `registerRoutes()` function:

```typescript
export async function registerRoutes(app: Express): Promise<Server> {
  const httpServer = createServer(app);
  
  // Setup authentication first (this registers /api/login, /api/register, etc.)
  setupAuth(app);
  
  // ... rest of the routes
}
```

## Verification
Tested production server - `/api/login` now responds with proper JSON:
```json
{"message":"Falha na autenticação. Verifique seu email e senha."}
```

## Status: FIXED ✅
- API routes properly registered
- Authentication endpoints working
- Production server rebuilt and tested
- Ready for Railway deployment

The login and all other API routes will now work correctly in production.
